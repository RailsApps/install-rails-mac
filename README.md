# Site for install-rails-mac.com

The site was previously built with <a href="https://slatedocs.github.io/slate">Slate</a>.

It's now just a redirect to a new site at [learn-rails.com](https://learn-rails.com/install-rails-mac/index.html).

## Deploy

The site is deployed at Netlify. Pushing to the master branch should trigger an automatic deploy.
